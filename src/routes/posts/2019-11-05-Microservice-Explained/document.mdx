## Introduction: 
<div className={styles["justifyContent"]}>
This is an article that mainly focusses on designing the Microservice architecture when your 
Monolithic application starts getting complex with a lot of new features and the addition of 
the new features and you want to make it Robust, Reliable and compatible without compromising 
its latency/concurrency. let's discuss when you should start re-defining your monolithic design 
into microservices and move the business logic by decomposing it into different services. 
What are all design pattern you should refer to structure your microservice? 
Why Domain-Driven Development and why it is the best choice for microservices? 
How microservice communicate using one-to and one-to-many with other services in its ecosystem? 
What are the message broker and its type? What is the saga pattern and how it is helpful 
to maintain concurrency across the services?

# Monolithic Vs Microservice 
<div className={styles["justifyContent"]}>
<b>Monolithic</b> When the software industry was evolving we were using monolithic architecture where all the logic is 
composed in one, consider a logistic system with 5 modules, Inventory Management, Transport Management, Packaging 
Management, Facility Location and Customer services. All these modules are part of a big logistics application and 
they communicate via Rest Api.As the company grows, the feature also grows which makes the application bulky and hard to
maintain. Suppose this application is developed using a programming language that is now obsolete, it will be difficult to 
update the application or if the company decided to update the language then development going to be affected which can cost
millions of losses to the company. Also how difficult it would be for developer to maintain and add a new feature, every time
they have to inform the whole dev  team to stop their development until the feature goes live, again this can be solved via 
Git but it's going to be worrying to do pull, rebase and merge again and again. Developer productivity going to be affected 
very badly. Monolithic architecture means everything is composed of one.

<br/>
<br/>

<b>Microservice</b>  In microservice, all different domains work as distributed services. One way to solve the above problem 
is to decompose these modules as different services and host them on different servers. This will solve the problem of 
programming language getting outdated. Also if a new programming language comes to the market and development team wants 
to refactor their code they can do it easily without affecting any other modules. When decomposing a monolithic into microservice, 
we should be considering the business logic, not the technical complexity. Finding the main classes in the monolithic and make 
them services. The reason for decomposing a monolithic application is to attain scalability, reliability, security, 
maintainability, testability, and deployability. Microservices is a set of loosely coupled services. Individual services 
across a microservice uses Rest Api or asynchronous messaging to do inter-process communication. We will be discussing 
more in-depth about the asynchronoud messaging in this series of articles. Domain-driven design(DDD) is the best practice 
to decompose an application to a subdomain. 
<br/>
<br/>
<b> Domain Driven Development, DDD: </b>To define domain-driven-design we should first establish what we mean by domain in 
this context (and in development in general). The common dictionary definition of the domain is: “A sphere of knowledge or 
activity.” Drilling down a bit from that, a domain in the realm of software engineering commonly refers to the subject 
area on which the application is intended to apply. In other words, during application development, the domain is the
“sphere of knowledge and activity around which the application logic revolves.”


InterProcess communication can be of two types. Synchronous and Asynchronous. In Synchronous we can think about it as a one 
to one communication where the client sends a request to server and wats for the response, Whereas in a many to many could 
be of two types Publish/Subscribe: Client publishes and server subscribe to it for the changes it wants to receive

<p className={styles["justifyContent"]}>
<b>Docker/Kubernetes:</b> It provide service registry and service discovery mechanism.

### Message Brocker
<div className={styles["justifyContent"]}>
A message broker is used for communicating between two services. Two types of message broker, broker less and broker based.
In broker based, the sender doesn't need to know the location of the consumer. Also, Broker buffer the data until consumer 
ready to accept it.<br/>
1) Active MQ <br/>
2) Rabit MQ <br/>
3) Apache Kafka <br/>
<b>Could based:<br/></b>
1) Aws Kinesis<br/>
2) AWS SQS

Messaging Standalone -> AMQP and STOMP does message broker support. messaging ordering, delivery guarantee, persistence, 
durability scalability, latency, competing consumers<br/>
<b>Handeling duplicate message:</b> 
Let's take an account of grocery delivery system. a client creates order and followed by canceling the same order. 
let suppose the order placed didn't acknowledge. and it tries again and it created the order again. 
Two ways to handle it<br/>
1) Write idempotent message handler<br/>
2) Track message and discard duplicate
</div>

### Load Balencer
<div className={styles["justifyContent"]}>
A load balancer is a device that acts as a reverse proxy and distributes network or application traffic across a 
number of servers. Load balancers are used to increase capacity (concurrent users) and reliability of applications.
<br/>
<b>Load Balancing Algorithms: </b>
Different load balancing algorithms provide different benefits; the choice of load balancing method depends on your needs: <br/>

1) Round Robin – Requests are distributed across the group of servers sequentially.<br/>
2) Least Connections – A new request is sent to the server with the fewest current connections to clients. 
The relative computing capacity of each server is factored into determining which one has the least connections.<br/>
3) IP Hash – The IP address of the client is used to determine which server receives the request.
</div>

### Sagas
<div className={styles["justifyContent"]}>
A saga is a sequence of local transactions. Each service in a saga performs its own transaction and publishes an event. 
The other services listen to that event and perform the next local transaction. If one transaction fails for some reason, 
the saga also executes compensating transactions to undo the impact of the preceding transactions.
It is used to maintain consistency in the distributed system. Given an example where you put a series of
a transaction is affected by the previous transaction. the current transaction is affected by the previous one. 
Think of an example like a logistic food delivery system or any other. Two ways to deal with a messaging transaction <br/>
<b>1) Orchestration:</b> In this approach, there is a Saga orchestrator that manages all the transactions and directs the 
participant services to execute local transactions based on events. Choreography is a pub/sub event babsed saga. for example if 
a service has to use three other service it will publish the events
and subscribe to those services to get the desired result.
This orchestrator can also be though of as a Saga Manager. <br/>
<b>2) Choreography: </b>In this approach, there is no central orchestrator. Each service participating in the Saga performs 
their transaction and publish events. The other services 
act upon those events and perform their transactions. Also, they may or not publish other events based on the situation. 
It uses orchastration class to tell each saga about their responsibility.
It communicate using command/asyn reply-stype interation. 
It's usefull to mode a saga as a state machine as it describe all possible scenarious. Testing Sagas

## Conclusion
We have discussed some benefits of using microservices over monolithic, in the next series of articles 
I'll be discussing more in-depth of message broker, Load Balancer and sagas.

 Aggregate: Take an example of an logistic company, which consist of fleet system, facility system, delivery system. Fist mile,
 mid mile and last mile. All these are noun.
 Patter aggregation: Organise a domain model as a collection of Aggregates, each of which is a group of objects that can be treated
 as a unit.
