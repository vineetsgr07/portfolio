## Introduction 

React and Angular have widely used web development frameworks for single-page applications for a very long time in the industry. 
In this article, I will explain how to react/angular work on the optimization to provide faster rendering on screen.

Before explaining the core algorithm of these two development frameworks we should have an idea of how HTML parser works and dom get displayed on the screen. Below is the workflow of WebKit which shows the stages through which HTML files goes before 
displaying on screen. Below is the workflow of WebKit which shows the stages through which HTML files goes before 
displaying on screen.

The first stage is the parsing of HTML and CSS to check for syntax validation once the renderer tree is constructed it merge it
with the style rules, next comes the Layout where each node in the Dom Tree get their coordinates, We write 
these coordinates as width and height while styling element. Next, it will go through painting where 
each node will be painted with the color codes specified in the style and later stage it gets displayed 
on the screen. For a detailed explanation refer 
[How Browser Work](http://taligarsiel.com/Projects/howbrowserswork1.htm#Introduction)

<div className={styles["webkit"]}>
  <img src={webkitflow} className={styles["logo-webkit"]} alt="logo" />
</div>
<div className={styles["center"]}> fig 1: How browsers work </div>

**Front-End Framework Comparision**
I'll be discussing the optimization technique used by react and Angular, How the re-construction 
of the tree happens when there's any change in the renderer tree. In React there's virtual Dom Tree is used
whereas angular uses a change detection technique to detach any node to make any changes to the view.


**React:**  React uses Virtual Dom to optimizing the renderer tree before painting on the screen, a json object which contains 
node's TagName, Attribute, style, props and other information to uniquely identify the node. When React application
runs it make a separate copy of each node in the form of a tree and each node represents json object refer Fig 2. 
let's say user perform any action in component D and Component E, once the change happens react will compare this tree with 
the actual dom using [diffing algorith](https://grfia.dlsi.ua.es/ml/algorithms/references/editsurvey_bille.pdf).
As a result, new Dom Tree will be created for rendering Component D, E, G and H, and only these component will get painted on the screen 
hence optimizing the rendering process.

```jsx
/* Virtual Dom Json Representation */
"nodeName": "div",
"children":[
    {
    "nodeName": "input",
    "attribute": {
      "type": "text",
      "placeholder":"search",
      "onchange":[]
    },
    "children":[]
  },
  {
    "nodeName": "List",
    "attribute": {
      "items":[
        "Jam",
        "Toast",
        "Butter"
      ]
    },
    "children":[]
  }
]
```

*Diffing Algorithm:* Comparing virtual dom with the actual dom. This algorithm makes sure the 
parsed object only goes to layout and then painting whenever necessary changes are required, 
it avoids unnecessary rendering of the tree. Complexity of this algorithm 
is log(n<sup>3</sup>). so if there are 1000 operation then there going to 1 billion comparisons.
 To avoid this much comparison react render the below nodes if something changes to parent, It won't 
 compare each node if changes detected at the parent. 
For more detailed explanation refer react's [reconciliation](https://reactjs.org/docs/reconciliation.html).


<div className={styles["logo"]}>
  <img src={virtualdom} className={styles["virtualdom-react"]} alt="logo" />
</div>
<div className={styles["center"]}>fig-2:Virtual dom: Action performed by user on component D and E </div>

<div className={styles["dom-height"]}>
  <img src={dom} className={styles["dom-react"]} alt="logo" />
</div>
<div className={styles["center"]}> fig 3: After comparison with actual DOM,Component D, E, G and H will update </div>

**Angular:** Angular uses a change detection technique to update the view. It is very interesting to note 
that Angular
creates [ViewData](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/8.0.x/packages/core/src/view/types.ts#L343) for
 all nodes
which are a json object and it contains all the information for the current node and if there's any child
 component it created it's instance and save in component
  [component](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/8.0.x/packages/core/src/view/types.ts#L351) key. 


A View is a fundamental building block of the application UI. It is the smallest grouping of 
Elements which are created and destroyed together. Properties of elements in a View can change, 
but the structure (number and order) of elements in a View cannot. Changing the structure of Elements can 
only be done by inserting, 
moving or removing nested Views via a ViewContainerRef. Each View can contain many View Containers.
