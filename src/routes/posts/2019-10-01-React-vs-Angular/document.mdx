## Introduction 

React and Angular are widely used web development framework for single page application from a very long time in industry. 
In this article i will explain how react/angular work on the optimisation to provide faster rendering on screen.

Before explaning the core algorithm of these two development framework we should have an idea of how HTML parserer works and 
dom get displayed on screen. Below is the workflow of webkit which shows the stages through which html files goes before 
displaing on screen.

First stage is the parsing of HTML and CSS to check for syntax validation once the renderer tree is contructd it merge it
with the style rules, next comes the Layout where each nodes in the Dom Tree get their coordinates, We write these coordinates as 
width and height while styling element. Next, it will goes through painting where earch nodes will be painted with the color codes 
specified in the style and in later stage it get displayed on screen. For detailed explanation refer [How Browser Work](http://taligarsiel.com/Projects/howbrowserswork1.htm#Introduction)

<div className={styles["webkit"]}>
  <img src={webkitflow} className={styles["logo-webkit"]} alt="logo" />
</div>
<div className={styles["center"]}> fig 1: How browsers work </div>

**Front-End Framework Comparision**
i'll be disscussing the optimisation technique used by react and Angular, How the re-construction of 
tree happen when there's any change in the  renderer tree. In react there's virtual Dom Tree used bt react
whereas angular use change detection technique to detech any node view change.


**React:** React uses Virtual Dom to optimising the renderer tree before painting on screen,a json object which contain 
node's TagName, Attribute, style, props and other information to uniquily identify the node. When react application
runs it make a seperate copy of each node in the form of tree and each node represent json object refer Fig 2. 
let's say user perform any action in component D and Component E, once the change happen react will compare this tree with 
the actual dom using [diffing algorith](https://grfia.dlsi.ua.es/ml/algorithms/references/editsurvey_bille.pdf).
As a result new Dom Tree will be created for rendering Component D, E, G and H and only these compoent will get painted on screen 
hence optimising the rendering process.

```jsx
/* Virtual Dom Json Representation */
"nodeName": "div",
"children":[
    {
    "nodeName": "input",
    "attribute": {
      "type": "text",
      "placeholder":"search",
      "onchange":[]
    },
    "children":[]
  },
  {
    "nodeName": "List",
    "attribute": {
      "items":[
        "Jam",
        "Toast",
        "Butter"
      ]
    },
    "children":[]
  }
]
```

*Diffing Algorithm:* Comparing virtual dom with the actual dom. This algorithm makes sure the parsed object only goes to layout 
and then painting whenever neccessary changes are requierd, it avoid unneccesary rendering of tree. Complexity of this algorithm 
is log(n<sup>3</sup>). so if there are 1000 operation then there going to 1 billion comparision. To avoid this much of comparision 
react render the below nodes if something changes to parent, It wont compare each and every nodes if changes detected at parent. 
For more detailed explanation refer react's [reconciliation](https://reactjs.org/docs/reconciliation.html).


<div className={styles["logo"]}>
  <img src={virtualdom} className={styles["virtualdom-react"]} alt="logo" />
</div>
<div className={styles["center"]}>fig-2:Virtual dom: Action performed by user on component D and E </div>

<div className={styles["dom-height"]}>
  <img src={dom} className={styles["dom-react"]} alt="logo" />
</div>
<div className={styles["center"]}> fig 3: After comparison with actual DOM,Component D, E, G and H will update </div>

**Angular:** Angular usses change detection technique to update the view. It is very intresting to note that Angular
creates [ViewData](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/8.0.x/packages/core/src/view/types.ts#L343) for all nodes
which is a json object and it contain all the information for current node and if there's any child compoent it created it's 
instance and save in component [component](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/8.0.x/packages/core/src/view/types.ts#L351) key. 

A View is a fundamental building block of the application UI. It is the smallest grouping of Elements which 
are created and destroyed together. Properties of elements in a View can change, but the structure (number 
and order) of elements in a View cannot. Changing the structure of Elements can only be done by inserting, 
moving or removing nested Views via a ViewContainerRef. Each View can contain many View Containers.
